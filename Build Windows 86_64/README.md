# SHMUP


This is the very first game I did with two friends, during a whole week. What I did is so full of flaws that I hesitated to share it, but hey, everybody has to start somewhere right ? I hope you'll enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it, even though it is frustratingly hard game
